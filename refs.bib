  isbn = {978-1-5386-0733-6},
  abstract = {In this paper we discuss and analyze possible futures for technologies in the field of computer vision (CV). Using a method we have coined speculative analysis we take a broad look at research trends in the field to categorize risks, analyze which ones are most threatening and likely, and ultimately summarize conclusions for how the field may attempt to stem future harms caused by CV technologies. We develop narrative case studies to provoke dialogue and deeply explore possible risk scenarios we found to be most probable and severe. We arrive at the position that there are serious potentials for CV to cause discriminatory harm and exacerbate cybersecurity issues.},

@article{greenDataSciencePolitical2019,
  title = {Data {{Science}} as {{Political Action}}},
  abstract = {In response to numerous recent controversies, the field of data science has rushed to adopt codes of ethics. Such professional codes, however, are ill-equipped to address broad matters of social justice. Instead of ethics codes, I argue, the field must embrace politics (by which I mean not simply debates about specific political parties and candidates but more broadly the collective social processes that influence rights, status, and resources across society). Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and, as befits political work, evaluate their work according to its downstream material impacts on people's lives.},
