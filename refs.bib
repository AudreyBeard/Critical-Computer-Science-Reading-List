  abstract = {A recent normative turn in computer science has brought concerns about fairness, bias, and accountability to the core of the field. Yet recent scholarship has warned that much of this technical work treats problematic features of the status quo as fixed, and fails to address deeper patterns of injustice and inequality. While acknowledging these critiques, we posit that computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems \textemdash{} roles whose value can be recognized even from a perspective that aspires toward fundamental social change. In this paper, we articulate four such roles, through an analysis that considers the opportunities as well as the significant risks inherent in such work. Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined \textemdash{} changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming computing's capacity to solve social problems on its own.},

Incorporating ethics into such courses raises particular challenges because of the timeintensive nature of the courses and because of the difficulty of finding material that is both relevant to the course and comprehensible to the students.

An ITiCSE 2010 Working Group discussed approaches for incorporating this material in the curriculum and outlined seven contrasting implementation cases [8]. Also, Baldwin et al discuss the implementation of computing curricula at five different liberal arts colleges [4]. However, none of these provides specific implementation details for addressing social issues in a liberal arts computing curriculum. This paper identifies successful strategies from one college and begins a general discussion of teaching social issues of computing in a liberal arts setting.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {In response to numerous recent controversies, the field of data science has rushed to adopt codes of ethics. Such professional codes, however, are ill-equipped to address broad matters of social justice. Instead of ethics codes, I argue, the field must embrace politics (by which I mean not simply debates about specific political parties and candidates but more broadly the collective social processes that influence rights, status, and resources across society). Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and, as befits political work, evaluate their work according to its downstream material impacts on people's lives.},

  abstract = {Abstraction, defined in Computer Science (CS) as bracketing unnecessary information from diverse components within a system, serves as a central epistemological axis in CS disciplinary and pedagogical practices. Its impressions can be seen across curricula, syllabi, classroom structures, IT systems; and other dimensions of the epistemic infrastructure of CS (Malazita [Forthcoming]. ``Epistemic Infrastructures, the Instrumental Turn, and the Digital Humanities.'' In Debates in the Digital Humanities: Infrastructures, Institutions at the Interstices, edited by Angel Nieves, Siobhan Senier, and Anne McGrail. University of Minnesota Press). As we will argue in this essay, abstraction in CS serves as an epistemic, cultural, and ideological wall to integrated critical-technical education, rather than as a bridge. Further, this wall is disguised as a bridge: the common language used across CS and the Humanities gives the impression that abstraction can be leveraged as a boundary object (Star [2010]. ``This is Not a Boundary Object: Reflections on the Origin of a Concept.'' Science, Technology, \& Human Values 35 (5): 601\textendash{}617), as a point of connection among conflicting or incommensurable epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina [1999]. Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge. Cambridge: MIT Press). Rather, computational knowledge practices leverage abstraction's homographic-ness, epistemically structuring collaborative efforts in anti-political ways. To illustrate the impacts of abstraction, this essay will introduce `Critical CS1,' a hybrid pedagogical approach to teaching Computer Science through feminist and critical race theory. However, other components of the epistemic infrastructures of Computer Science, from curricular structure, to IT systems, to classroom culture, to the epistemic practices of coding itself, resisted these intervention efforts, and reproduced marginalizing effects upon students within the course.},

We develop narrative case studies to provoke dialogue and deeply explore possible risk scenarios we found to be most probable and severe. We arrive at the position that there are serious potentials for CV to cause discriminatory harm and exacerbate cybersecurity issues.},

  author = {Varelas, Maria and Martin, Danny B. and Kane, Justine M.},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {We present a theoretical framework that views learning as a process involving content learning (CL) and identity construction (IC). We view identities as lenses through which people make sense of, and position themselves, through stories and actions, and as lenses for understanding how they are positioned by others. As people become more (or less) central members of a disciplinary community (e.g., a science or mathematics classroom) and engage (or not) in various cultural practices, changes in identity and knowledge accompany changes in position and status. Identity construction (IC) and content learning (CL) share an important characteristic: they both involve meaning making. For IC, it is the development of reasoned, coordinated, coherent, and meaningful ways of seeing one's self in relation to communities, and for CL, it centers on the development of disciplinary concepts, processes, tools, language, discourse, and norms within practices. Focusing on Black students in mathematics and science classrooms, we claim that three intersecting identities are particularly important: disciplinary identity (as doers of the discipline, i.e., mathematics and science), racial identity (emerging understandings of what it means to be Black), and
academic identity (as participants in academic tasks and classroom practices). In this paper, we elaborate on the CLIC framework as a useful tool for understanding how Black students negotiate participation in, and come to see themselves as doers of science and mathematics in their school classrooms. We synthesize empirical findings from our research with younger and older students, as well as with parents and community members, to illustrate dimensions of this framework.},
