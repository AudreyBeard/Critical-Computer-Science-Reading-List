\section{Introduction}
The intent of this document is to provide context for Critical Computer Science Pedagogy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Being rooted in computer vision and machine learning, I undoubtedly bias my literature review towards those topics.
This document is broken into several sections, ranging from "pure" pedagogical theory, to science and technology studies (STS) literature, to "pure" computer science papers.
